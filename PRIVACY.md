# Amethyst Privacy Policy

Effective as of Jan 20, 2023.

The Amethyst app for Android does not collect or process any personal information from its users. The app is used to connect to third-party Nostr servers (also called Relays) that may or may not collect personal information and are not covered by this privacy policy. Each third-party relay server comes equipped with its own privacy policy that can be viewed through the app or through that server's website. The developers of this open source project or maintainers of the distribution channels (app stores) do not have access to the data located in the user's phone before it's shared with third-party Nostr servers. Accounts are fully maintained by the user. We do not have control over them. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the app after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
